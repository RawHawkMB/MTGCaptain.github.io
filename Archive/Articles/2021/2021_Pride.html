					  <img src="/img/MTG-Pride.jpg" alt="LGBTQ_PRIDE" class="img-fluid">
                        <p>
                        Hello every and we are so glad to see you join us in celebrating LGBTQ+ Pride this June 2021! <BR>
						<BR>
						To celebrate we are going to go over the LGBT characters and cards so far seen and supported by Wizards of the Coast with thanks to <a href="https://scryfall.com/"><Strong>Scryfalls' Pride</Strong></a> front page support.
                         </p>


						<h2 class="pt-2 tm-mb-40 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Chandra Nalaar</h2>
						Starting the list on a sizzling relationship than really blossomed over time. <BR>
						<BR> Chandra Nalaar, a bisexual girl from Kaladesh had the hots for a girl very down to earth - Nissa Revane. <BR>
						<BR> The story about Chandra is very sweet and innocent. A young girl feels a warm butterflies feeling every time she sees a cute girl and just doesn't know how to talk to her at first. Very touching and heart felt.
						<img src="/img/Chandra.jpg" alt="LGBTQ_Model" class="img-fluid">
						
						
						
						<h2 class="pt-2 tm-mb-40 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Nissa Revane</h2>
						Moving on to her sweetheart, Nissa Revane is a hard to read elf who seems interested and humble in learning and teaching with Chandra's fiery temper.<BR>
						<BR> These two are super cute together. It is hard to tell but Nissa could be biromantic asexual or possibly just a shy lesbian. Either way she is a gentle spirit to be adored. <BR>
						<BR> This fem couple will be iconic for many many years to come!
						<img src="/img/Nissa.jpg" alt="LGBTQ_Model" class="img-fluid">						
						
						
						
						<h2 class="pt-2 tm-mb-40 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Alena, Kessig Trapper</h2>
						A heavily alluded to story from the original Innistrad had many fans begging for more. <BR>
						<BR> Fear not! We finally got this wonderful couple. Alena + Halana are two humans able to go toe to toe with vampires, werewolves, zombies, and even ELDRAZI! <BR>
						<BR>Her flavour text is also super cute!<BR>
						<Strong> Halana and I have a bond that'll never be broken.  </Strong>
						<img src="/img/Hanna_Alesha.jpg" alt="LGBTQ_Model" class="img-fluid">
						
						
						
						<h2 class="pt-2 tm-mb-40 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Halana, Kessig Ranger</h2>
						To be the other half of her part Halana is Alena's life long partner. No really. <BR>
						<BR> They both share the Partner mechanic and work really well of of each other's abilities! <BR>
						<BR> This lesbian couple are too cute! See their couples photo above.
						
						
						
						
						<h2 class="pt-2 tm-mb-40 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Oviya Pashiri</h2>						
						What a sweet old lady. Helping organize a revolution against oppressive authoritarians. Always one to support the servos so they can play and frollic. <BR>
						<BR> It was not much but in passing it was mentioned Oviya had a wife she cared about. At the time of release this flew under the radar. <BR>
						<BR> In today's environment we would expect to see more but it was a good try WotC!
						<img src="/img/Oviya_Pashiri_Sage_Lifecrafter.png" alt="LGBTQ_Model" class="img-fluid">
						
						
						
						<h2 class="pt-2 tm-mb-40 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Kynakos and Tiro of Meletis</h2>
						These very masculine men show a softer side. A romantic and affection not often seen in any card. <BR>
						<BR> Not only are these men emotionally strong but they also usupered a radical dictator and became beloved kings of their times. <BR>
						<BR> Many loved and adored their kings and praised them for their valliant efforts to free the people of their shackles. <BR>
						<BR> This card would highly praised at release and remains highly favored of all communities for being 4 colors and flavor rich, showing strength of love in the face of hate. <BR>
						<BR> Sadly it is found out many millenia later people forgot the realities and believed these lovers to be rivals.
						<img src="/img/Kynakos_and_Tiro.jpg" alt="LGBTQ_Model" class="img-fluid">
						
						
						
						<h2 class="pt-2 tm-mb-40 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Ral Zarek</h2>						
						What a shocking and smart man Ral Zarak is! What he has in incredible intelligence he also has in love for his lover, Tomik. <BR>
						<BR> These love birds wear a strip of the others garmets to be together always, and find each other even when an out of worldly Bolas zombie army attacks. <BR>
						<BR> Putting these traits aside Ral could very well be one of the sexiest MTG men ever printed. Rawr!
						<img src="/img/Ral.jpg" alt="LGBTQ_Model" class="img-fluid">
						
						
						
						<h2 class="pt-2 tm-mb-40 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Tomik, Distinguished Advokist</h2>						
						Tomik is a book worm with a heart of gold. He keeps his lovers cloth around his wrist and cannot help but touch foreheads as a sign of love when he sees his man. <BR>
						<BR> Being one of the most distiguished council book keepers in Ravinica it shows brains, beauty, and love is what each partner sees in the other. <BR>
						<BR> Little does Tomik realize he is always on Rals mind, no matter which world Ral is on.
						<img src="/img/Tomik.jpg" alt="LGBTQ_Model" class="img-fluid">
						
						
						
						<h2 class="pt-2 tm-mb-40 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Alesha, Who Smiles at Death</h2>
						What a rockstar hero! Alesha takes names, kicks ass, and plows her way through Orc skulls to victory in a harsh Mardu clan world. <BR>
						<BR> Alesha is Magic's first trans male to female character. I was worried when I found out fearing the card would be nerfed. Boy was I wrong! <BR> 
						<BR> This girl is a heavy metal machine that makes her enemies tremble at their knees. <BR> 
						<BR> A great card to prove how awesome trans people are! 10/10 WotC
						<img src="/img/Alesha.jpg" alt="LGBTQ_Model" class="img-fluid">
						
						
						
						<h2 class="pt-2 tm-mb-40 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Lazav, Dimir Mastermind</h2>						
						Now you may be saying no way Lazav is on the list? Yep. Lazav is non-binary using he/him pronouns. <BR> 
						 <BR> Sometimes he is a sweet old lady watching for planeswalker sparks to form, sometimes he is Chandra - a hot hot hot bisexual, sometimes he could be some brutish man in a bar starting rumors about some other guild. <BR> 
						<BR> with shapeshifters in general they could all be considered gender fluid in a literal way sometimes. It is great to see Ravnica leaders are so full of the LGBTQ+ <BR> 
						<img src="/img/Lazav.jpg" alt="LGBTQ_Model" class="img-fluid">
						
						
						<h2 class="pt-2 tm-mb-40 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Yahenni, Undying Partisan</h2>
						A great example of a non-binary character, let's talk about Yahenni. They have the candure that is fem with the astetics of a confident masc body of gas. <BR> 
						 <BR> Speaking of what a gas they are we cannot forget every single Aetherborn is non-binary, parties, lives life to the fullest, and never lets the future stop them in the present! <BR> 
						 <BR> What a fabulous race of beings!
						<img src="/img/Yahenni.jpg" alt="LGBTQ_Model" class="img-fluid">
						
						
						<h2 class="pt-2 tm-mb-40 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Hallar, the Firefletcher</h2>						
						 <BR> Hallar did not make a ton of waves in the community. It could be said that now that the LGBTQ+ are growing more dominantly standard in every set this is normalized.  <BR> 
						 <BR> Which is great. Kicker is this card also showcases the strength of character non-binary have. Lovin' it keep the flow of great designs up! <BR>
						 <BR> Great to see a masc elf doing what elves do. Nice touch on Hallar riding a tamed beat while using a bow. That ain't easy!
						<img src="/img/Hallar.jpg" alt="LGBTQ_Model" class="img-fluid">
						
						
						
						<h2 class="pt-2 tm-mb-40 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Alharu, Solemn Ritualist</h2>						
						A subtle non-binary character. Alharu as a child thought they were haunted by ghosts but as they matured realized they were a caretaker of spirits. <BR>
						 <BR> It is great to see such a spiritual take on non-binary characters as they come in all shapes, sizes, beliefs, and super powers.  <BR>
						 <BR> Their tattoos also display how artistic and charming non-binary magic designs can be. Very well done.
						<img src="/img/Alharu.jpg" alt="LGBTQ_Model" class="img-fluid">
						
						
						
						<h2 class="pt-2 tm-mb-40 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Xantcha, Sleeper Agent</h2>						
						Now here is a very early example of a gender fluid character in a time when the LGBTQ+ were most attacked in the MTG community.  <BR>
						<BR> Fortunately today we all love and embrace the LGBTQ+ in all Magic the Gathering communities as that is the only right thing to do.  <BR>
						<BR> Xantcha was born as a Phyrexian Newt or as an androgenous humanoid.  <BR>
						<BR> Later in life Xantcha decided to use gendered pronouns to hide her identity in a society that would raise eyebrows otherwise.
						<img src="/img/Xantcha.jpg" alt="LGBTQ_Model" class="img-fluid">
						
						
						
						<h2 class="pt-2 tm-mb-40 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver</h2>						
						What a nightmarish creature. This genderless non-binary planeswalker is very proud and up front about they/them pronouns.  <BR>
						<BR> A chilling and skin crawling figure that toys with beings dreams to weild them like rubber bands around their fingers. <BR>
						<BR> Just thinking about this very story rich and clever being makes me passionate about reading all the classics in MTG stories.
						<img src="/img/Ashiok.jpg" alt="LGBTQ_Model" class="img-fluid">
						
						
						
						<h2 class="pt-2 tm-mb-40 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Niko Aris</h2>
						Niko Aris was an athlete on Theros cursed with never being able to fail. What a sad terrible curse that is eh?  <BR>
						<BR> The gods favored Niko and thought it wise to make them so great at everything they did. It took great efforts to be successful at failing and then... Nike Aris spark ignited!  <BR>
						<BR> Niko was cataspulted into a badass metal world of LGBTQ+ vikings! *Insert heavy metal riffs*  <BR>
						<BR> Along the way they met other non-binary, and trans friends as well as a same sex male couple. Vikings don't give a #*%! so long as you can smash and bash! RAWRRRR!!!
						<img src="/img/NikoAris.jpg" alt="LGBTQ_Model" class="img-fluid">
						
						
						
						
						<h2 class="pt-2 tm-mb-40 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Nassari, Dean of Expression</h2>
						Recently we visited a magical world of wizards and learning. One lesson we all learned is how fabulous and expressive some schools are. <BR>
						<BR>One such Dean of these schools, Nassari, is a great example of how it does not matter how we look or act. So long as we can and do express our selves freely in a body positive way there is nothing wrong with libration of ones self.  <BR>
						<BR> This is so successful it shows. Being a non-binary dean can make one's self a legend in an instant. We have much to learn from teachers.
