								<li> Qwerty Alex initiated a conversation to Raw Hawk suggesting the October 7, 2020 vote to impliment IT's suepr admin roles into Discord was discussed in such a way to say it would grant IT fulled access equal to what the current Moderators have, allowing IT to abuse the powers Mods use. </li>
								<li> Raw replied back explaining this vote was democratically made with or without Alex's approval. Initally after the vote Alex was willing to work with IT but kept delaying action. Every concern Alex has of what could happen, has happened with Mods without checks and balances. (All of which Raw voiced and Mods disregarded since Day 1)  </li>
								<li> Alex did disagree with the legitamacy of the vote and of the people in IT and of the methods originally Alex agreed all to. </li>
								<li> Raw did reply to each comment and noted back door conversations were happening at the Moderator level with HobbitWhoCould and others.<BR>
								This problem being one of the reasons it would not be an incorrect statement to say some of the Mods (ie. Alex) have abused. </li>
								<li> Alex attempted to flex their education of IT.  </li>
								<li> Raw asked for this to stop as Raw also has a diploma in IT plus 10 years additional expierence. Flexing education will not end well, to which Alex did conceed this was in their error to try.  </li>
								<li> Raw asked Alex for permission for screenshot gallery of PMs.  </li>
								<li> Alex agreed.  </li>
								<li> Raw asked SM for permission to post back door deals.  </li>
								<li> Mad Matt agreed.  </li>
								<li> Raw provided. Raw asked Alex to do the same and provide screenshots of backdoor conversations as transparency is a pillar of the Captain format.  </li>
								<li> Alex told Raw to go ask those others as Alex doesn't want to.  </li>
								<li> Raw Private Messaged - asked Hobbit for logs. Hobbit said Hobbit does not want to but is okay if Alex shares. Alex then said Alex does not want to unless Hobbit okays it. Raw asked Hobbit to 'Okay' Alex sharing as Alex has 'Okay'd' Hobbit already. Hobbit did not answer yes or no, offering Alex to say yas or no. Raw Asked Alex to which Alex suggested this is now harassment and must stop. Raw stopped after noting Raw was only following the conversation, and Alex has now hidden public evidence privately between Hobbit and Alex. </li>
								<li> Alex suggested Raw is power grabbing for more IT controls.  </li>
								<li> Raw reminded Alex Raw has ZERO IT controls being an EA as this was many times already communicated.  </li>
								<li> Alex continued this assertion regardless.  </li>
								<li> Back and forth of who would be able to do what continued. Raw not being IT cannot perform IT actions Alex suggests Raw could do.  </li>
								<li> Alex suggested this would require a Constitution admendment and section XI (HobbitWhoCould's copyright flase claims) would prevent me from advancing.  </li>
								<li> Hobbit private messaged Raw suggesting Raw cool down as Mods and other Mod supporters are talking about how to ban Raw in a private group chat. <BR>
								Raw said thanks for that and asked Hobbit to keep things transparent. Not to becomer part of the back door dealers.	</li>
								<li> Raw explained less the technical, more the practical reasons why reducing an attack vector is a good thing and noted because this sage advice has been ignored since day 1 Mods have been responsible for every account hacked, stolen, lost. Where as IT had prevented an attack very recently and more other attacks on a regular occurance. </li>
								<li> Alex suggested numerious vauge IT solutions without offering how these solutions could be made or used.  </li>
								<li> Raw noted every time one of Alex solutions is completed the goal posts are moved, and Alex finds a new reason to deny this democratically voted in process.  </li>

								<li> Hobbit suggested if EAs were to vote to allow the public to vote on if the EAs should be interpretors of the Community Constitution, Hobbit would invoke Constitution section IX claiming Hobbit is owner of this document and no one but Hobbit is allowed final say as to what can or cannot be edited into the Constitution.  </li>
								<li> This threat of violence against Captain format immediately upset many EAs and scoured the vote.  </li>
								<li> For the next several days even Hobbits closest allies admitted this was a malicious act of bad faith though some wanted to still promote Hobbits unelected, uncontrolled and unaccountable power and domance over the format.  </li>
