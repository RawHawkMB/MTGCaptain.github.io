						I hereby tender my resignation.  I'm going to be stepping away from magic completely for awhile.  One of the criticisms we've gotten is that we're just "playing government." I had believed that we were actually trying to build something, but it seems true building isn't actually feasible.  I'll likely be pulling away from other areas of life too.  Farewell and good luck.

					<HR>
					<button class="accordion">EA: Shushir#4597</button>

						<p>
						My main reason for resigning is specifically due to the fact that I don't think democracy can properly exist while any one person, especially one who's willing to attack the democratic foundations of the format, wields such power. I sincerely hope I'm wrong for your sake and all the remaining EA's.
						<BR> Good luck, and may the cards be in your favor.
						<BR> If Hobbit continues to choke the democracy of the format, everyone will hopefully see it for what it is.

						What to say what to say? Hmmmm. <BR>
						<BR>
						I guess at the beginning would be a good place to start. I heard Mitch announce Captain and got very excited. Being a Socialist I instantly thought this is what we need to introduce democracy into a game I have been in for over 18 years now. Hierarchy based rules will also flounder in comparison. I ran to my PC, created the current official Captain subreddit <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/MTGCaptain">/r/MTGCaptain</a>. It seems mere moments later people were flooding in and it began. 
						<BR> <BR>
						Little did I know (literal) Nazis and bigots of all other natures too were battling inside Mitch's Captain discord for domonance over progressives. Had I known this at that time or that while the names change, the results stay the same, I probably would have watched from the side lines and let Captain die in a week.
						<BR> <BR> 
						Alas I am stubborn and a perfectionist mixed with extreme civil rights activism. I jumped into discord and with a decade of IT cyber security reached out to the moderators of discord to tell them of all the obvious to me holes that need the most attention of patching. I gave my credentials, intentions, and offer to help. Basically got a 'fuck off we're busy' which wasn't a lie but also was very naive. I watched every report I gave come true. It went from daily events coming true to it lasting weeks, months, and now 9 months total. Wow has time gone by. One favorite moment in this time was being the one to put the final nail in LawyersPlaysDota2 coffin. Very satisfied when even Alex of all people complimented and praised me for knowing how to deal with Bigots. It was a skill I have sharpened since.
						<BR> <BR> 
						Soon after I developed the current official Captain website www.MTGCaptain.cards and at around this time all other IT left as the mods could not even find the 30 seconds to fix the IT role to allow us to send text and use voice. Alex was asked by many and denied all stating he was too busy to help meanwhile the format renaming conversations were getting full support.
						<BR> <BR> 
						Going toe to toe with Nazis in the start to now toe to toe with authoritarians who would rather lie, cheat, and self-mutilate the format than let democracy win. I have found yet again another prediction (published May 26, 2021) come true. 
						<BR> <BR> 
						It was found that Alex admitted in confidence with select members to seeking some way, any way to get rid of myself while not losing community support. This information was given to me by whistle blowers from as early as January 2021 to a time and date I will withhold for their own safety. Hobbit had tried to wield authoritarian powers over Elected Administrators back in March 21, 2021. Causing two Elected Administrators to resign as they knew the Elected Adminstrators would not gain support from the loud minority members of Captain to overturn Hobbit without a fight. This fight would be unnessusary and is only maintained as a power grab for the sake of having power not the use of it.
						<BR> <BR> 
						Defeated not by one member but by the many Captain members, Hobbit announced their resignation from Captain and has moved on to 'new projects'.
						<BR> <BR> 
						And so, the community moved forward. However this is a bit too optimistic for reality. Sadly.
						<BR> <BR> 
						Then came the bigots the next day until present. Myself and a few others continue to receive random throw away account messages with slurs, hate speech, and bigotry demanding we all quit. We are almost their folks, I swear! This ship is almost full circle.
						<BR> <BR> 
						It was in the last half of May things started to get wild. Attempts through false legal claims were made on many fronts, all of which were internal. Dog whistles to dismantle democracy (which was voted on by the many) in favor of authroitarian hierarchy. With no legal teeth behind these claims they were dusted off.
						<BR> <BR> 
						Through careful planning Hobbit coordinated a I will admit very clever coup. Coming back from the grave he was force buried into, Hobbit made half-baked legal threats until someone would crack. This was the opportunity needed. It was just a matter of time as the cheese was placed in the trap.
						<BR> <BR> 
						June 7, 2021 I asked a mod (whom I feel we mutually respect each other) and got approval (as previously LGBTQ+ topics were banned up to this point for falsely being a get this, a 'political' topic) to talk about Pride month. I went to Social Media and got an insensitive response from someone I respect, and soon after a reponse from someone who well... On numerous occassions in voice chat had no problem calling 'my kind' the F@& word. One mod and I have had chats with him before so I know the mods know about this persons Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde nature. Bigots like these never left. But they are not the reason I am leaving as their petty acts of hate speech are not what killed Captain.
						<BR> <BR> 
						With no notice and no follow up I am suddenly perma banned from that discord. You can imagine my reaction being that I talk about a forbidden topic that just got approval and then get the boot with zero people telling me what is going on.
						<BR> <BR> 
						Well now, as it turns out Alex used Hobbits hysterical half-baked legal claims as a reason to eject me. Anyone with a high school education would see those documents and laugh the server out the door. Not that Alex will release any of the Captain chats behind closed doors as required by Captains foundation or the foundation of how the Mods got their power. With this Alex and their cliche believed this to essentially be myself becoming dissolved from the format. However the mods much to Alex dismay never had this power. 
						<BR> <BR> 
						In a hypothetical court room, the Elected Administrators are closer to a jury of peers where as the mods are closer to a police officer that must follow the law. Do with this information as you will.
						<BR> <BR> 
						Alex did also find a chronology of every single power group, all the trolls, coups, and all other information for transparency purposes readily available in their discord server. This information is all public knowledge and organized to help correct would be power grabbers of their past and likley future. This page was not intended to be public as it was only a backup of known information. It was removed as it was not untrue, rather it triggered a lot of snowflakes which was not the purpose of this document. I expect by the time you are reading this discord, such text may be getting purged or history rewritten to fit a certain narrative. This. This right here is why I am quitting Elected Administrator position.
						<BR> <BR> 
						It was not the bigots, the trolls, the predictable and laughable results of authoritarian smooth brains. It was that those who promised not to over reach did so and were rewarded, while those who faught against oligarchy were salted down and burrated. One by one progressivist left.
						<BR> <BR> 
						I imagine I will continue to be told by the half dozen or so whistle blowers of silly stupid behaviour. We will laugh together knowing while democracy was ejected, it is not dead. To those out there unsure, I ask you. Please see what this is and who seeks to control it.
						<BR> <BR> 
						While Hobbit today (June 9, 2021) would like to see myself and the other 3 EAs as well as the 3 mods be masters of this format I cannot be in a format that would not ask it's members to vote on this rapid change. I know it will happen as Hobbit runs the show now.
						<BR> <BR> 
						<Strong> The Captain discord is now three small children in their dad's trench coat trying to get into the movie theater all three lieing about their age forgetting who is supposed to be the head. </Strong>
						<BR> <BR>  <BR>
						With this, I resign. To not pull a Hobbit and try to crawl back ragged and bagged. I have deleted all IT super admin accounts and all Social Media back doors. If you forget your social media password you now have zero support in fixing it. Sorry folks, I really am. You have no more IT left.
						<BR> <BR> 
						In addition I am going to make a lottery of all Captain discord members who have not talked in the last 30 days and will give them the website. It will literally be safer in a strangers hands than an authoritarian who would rather self-mutilate the format to make a point. The website is hosted on github and Decidim while almost completed is spinning down. It will remain archived and available until July 9th to be booted up should someone be able to contact me and prove they are part of Captain, account is older than 30 days, and can answer a few complex IT questions to prove they understand what they are volunteering for.
						<BR> <BR>  <BR>
						Hobbit, when we first were chatting you seemed like a really cool guy even though you sell death of a living. Losing sleep over it I though you showed promise and humility. I was mistaken.
						<BR> <BR> 
						VanVelding, I know you think lowly of me. Going so far to compare me the Socialist to a polar opposite Laywers Nazi. Fear not, I will not nuke any accounts. Between us I am a professional and have dealt with more prickly people than yourself. Love ya my sweet summer child!
						<BR> <BR> 
						Alex, Hey gorg how are you. Girl that wig is snatched. Bye Feliciaaaa!
						<BR> <BR> 
						Mahijok and Hammer. We didn't chat much in the end but I liked you two. Both of you were usually able to see through Alex BS though I do not blame you for having to do things because you were told to and things you were told not to do. It's part of the unpaid job I guess... Still respect you both outside of Captain.
						<BR> <BR> 
						Orc, now that we do not have the pleasure in daily dealings together my ears are going to feel so much better. No more whistling for me, but hey keep playing those tunes.
						<BR> <BR> 
						Foot, while you did totally ghost me in the end I still really liked gaming with you and your bro. Both of you are cool.
						<BR> <BR> 
						David, you were always a pleasure to talk to and had some great Golgari plays. Your sense of humor and putting up with my terrible humor was great.
						<BR> <BR> 
						Blind, we never gamed but I felt you were always able to see through the sludge and nuance of those would be power trippers. I feel you have a good head of your sholders.
						<BR> <BR> 
						Xen, you were always honest and never held back calling out the cringe. Loved working with ya and will take pleasure in the memories on here calling out the grifters. This will be my last shout out, hope you enjoy the fireworks ahead!
						<BR> <BR> 
						I would mention more but many of them have moved on but stay here to watch the tea being spilled like a good drama flick. <BR>
						To anyone else I may have forgotten, farewell and take care.. I hope to see you another brighter day!

						<h4 class="pt-3 tm-mb-20 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Ammo37#1317</h4>
					<p>
					I was on the ground floor at the creation of this format. Sat through meetings and philosophy discussions before we had any kind of structure within discord. Helped collate people after the diaspora. I've always put the format first above my own feelings and ideas and I will continue to do so. I firmly believe in the ethical core of Captain, transparency and community led format. I have my own ideas I'd like to champion and discuss, but I am not married to my own ideas. I will uphold that anything we do must be thought out and discussed, and have reasoning behind it. I will act as a foil for others' ideas to explore their merit and refine them. Above all I wish to see this format grow and thrive as I know it can. We have already accomplished something amazing, now we just need to keep it going.
					</p> <BR>
					
					
						<h4 class="pt-3 tm-mb-20 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Furry Combat Wombat#4959</h4>
					<p>
					Hello, my name is Furrycombatwombat, and I'd love to have the honor of being one of your elected administrators. I have been playing MtG for around 10 years. I have experience in nearly every format at many competetive levels. <BR> <BR> As such, I have a firm understanding of how card interactions can either be healthy or toxic to the fun of the game for all players. Feel free to dm me with any questions :D
					</p> <BR>

						<h4 class="pt-3 tm-mb-20 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Mekkis#8195</h4>
					<p>
					I'm nominating myself for EA. <BR>
					A bit about myself: In my two decades of Magic, I have been a good magic player. Then an L2 Judge. Now I am neither :) <BR>
					I am a firm believer in evidence over anecdote, and results over hyperbole. I will try to ensure proposals are based on documented evidence. <BR>
					I am willing to accept that the Captain format may sit in a lull for some time, but needs to be ready for the next influx of interest when WotC inevitably makes Another Bad Decision. <BR>
					To this end, I believe that we need to largely maintain compatibility with EDH, and display cohesion and community to prevent a rehash of the Previous Discord Server. <BR>
					As a player in the APAC region, I hope to counter the apparent US-centric bias that we have seen. <BR>
					If you have any questions on where I stand, please message me and I'll try to get back to you.

						<h4 class="pt-3 tm-mb-20 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">RawHawk#1093</h4>
					<p>
					Hello,<BR> <BR>

					I would like to enter this role as an Elected Administrator. My education, certificates, diplomas, and real life experience in administration would give me the skills to enact popular demand into reality.<BR> <BR>

					With a decade of experience as a Senior network, systems, security, and infrastructure administrator I have the disciplines to see a demand and implement it in a way that not only functions but also serves a purpose greater to the many over the few.<BR>

					Since October 2003 I have been actively playing Magic the Gathering starting as a Vintage player eventually branching out to Modern, EDH, Standard, and now Captain. With these 17 years of experience in the community I have seen many shifts and changes. One thing always stays the same. Wizards of the Coast is a company and we are buying their product. But the product is not what we remember. It is the times enjoying the product with the people we care about. Winning, losing, and sometimes turns taking so long we run out of time to play. Smiles, forehead wrinkles, head scratches, asking "Will you pay 1 for that?".<BR> <BR>

					Protecting the time spent and quality of gameplay is why I am running. Whatever the community demands I will enact.<BR> <BR>
					If the community mass demands something I do not want, I will be the first person to volunteer to code the web page to announce the new changes the community wants. It is us working together democratically that will bring balance back to this game.<BR> <BR>

					It is the purpose of an EA to push new changes across without bias. I will enforce the Constitution and will demand rigid guidelines all EAs must follow with complete transparency. <BR> <BR>

					I hope I get your vote.<BR> <BR>

					Thank you,<BR>
					RawHawk#1093

						<h4 class="pt-3 tm-mb-20 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Shushir#4597</h4>
					<p>
					Hey all, Shushir here. I'm announcing my candidacy for the position of Elected Administrator. I view the position of Administrator as a conduit to reflect and carry out the will of the Captain community at large, which I believe should take precedence over my own opinions on any specific changes to the format or Constitution. I am confident that my years of leadership experience in both logistical and executive roles in multiple organizations will serve the community well and help carry out their will effectively and efficiently. While I believe that the community's will at large should carry precedence over any of my own positions as an individual, I would like to take steps to help increase deck and playstyle diversity within the format of Captain, including steps to make aggro a more viable archetype in a format where combo and control decks seem to reign supreme by numbers. I hope that the community will chose to put me in a position in which I'm able to best carry out my primary goal, which is to help the format grow and prosper, and to build a strong, interconnected community. If anyone has any questions about my opinions on any specific format issues, I will freely discuss them.
					</p> <BR>
					
					
						<h4 class="pt-3 tm-mb-20 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">SillyHalfOrc#5235</h4>
					<p>
					I know this format cannot survive as a Commander derivative. We need to experiment with new rules, bold changes and better ban list management. As an EA I promise to be open to crazy and radical departures. <BR> <BR>
					I see the blacklist as a direct obstacle to our democratic intentions and our evolution. I think that if the community wants to play with silver boarder cards, conspiracies or even BABs they should be able to. The way it is structured to be resistant to change is frustrating as the community is capable of self-regulation.<BR> <BR>
					Above all the will of the community is the most important thing. Regardless of what I want the community comes first.
					</p> <BR>
					
					
						<h4 class="pt-3 tm-mb-20 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">That.Schrade#5566</h4>
					<p>
					I nominate myself, That.Schrade, for the position of elected administrator. I am fairly new to the game as I have only been playing for around 4 years. I originally got into Commander because of the opportunity for multiple different and unique play styles and decks. As an EA, I will be looking for all crazy and unique ideas that the community has. I think for Captain to grow and evolve into something separate from Commander, it has to be open to new suggestions and various ideas coming together. My dms will always be open to those who have ideas or just want ask me about something.
					</p> <BR>
					
						<h4 class="pt-3 tm-mb-20 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Xenagos#6969</h4>
					<p>
					Hello my name is Xenagos and I’m here to officially announce my candidacy for EA. I’ve been active in the creation of the Captain format since the beginning, and a magic player for nearly a decade. I want to help elevate the voices of the community while maintaining transparency and reasoning in my decisions. Most importantly, I vow that I shall not be cringe. I look forward to serving the Captain community. If you have any questions about my platform, do not hesitate to reach out.
					</p> <BR>
					
					
						<h4 class="pt-3 tm-mb-20 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">YinsoTheAkuma#9229</h4>
					<p>
					I nominate myself, Yinso the Akuma. The Captain Format is chiefly a democratic endeavor run by the community. The role of EAs is to facilitate the will of the community and strictly obey the Constitution as-written. It's not a position that requires conventional political agendas and it does not carry any power, only duties to serve, to be eminently answerable to the community, and to hold other EAs to that same standard. As a member of the community, I think Captain is in trouble. We've lost a lot of inertia and morale is low. We need to create ways to engage our existing community, demonstrate value to potential members, and distinguish ourselves from Commander. Captain conludia est.
					</p> <BR>
